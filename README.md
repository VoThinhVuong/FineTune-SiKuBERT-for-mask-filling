# How to mask data
1. Put txt file that needs to be masked into not_masked_data.
2. Run mask_data.py

# Results
* Masked files are put into masked_data folder.
* data.txt is the combination of all masked files.  

# IMPORTANT!!!
* Since the masking is random, data.txt will be overwritten with a different version on each mask_data.py excecution => If needed, save each iteration of data.txt (and masked_data) somewhere else.
